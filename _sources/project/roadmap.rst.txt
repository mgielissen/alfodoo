* Manage versions when a document is uploaded (selection between minor or major version, add comment information) 
* Display document versions: Preview/download of a specific version of an item. Preview of the item associated properties
* Edit offline (item check-out & locking)/Update a new version/Cancel editing (document unlock)
* Edit online (with MS Office suite)
* Folder suppression: synchronization between the odoo record and the linked alfresco folder
* Some sort of document type management.
* Some sort of meta-data synchronization
* A new field CmisDocument used to link to a specific CMIS document/version in an Odoo form (with its dedicated widget)
* Some kind of integration between Odoo e-mailing and Alfresco
* A new controller acting as a proxy between Odoo and CMIS to avoid to allow CORS requests and simplify the deployment.
  This functionality is under development see https://github.com/acsone/alfodoo/pull/4
